GitLens ‚Äî Supercharge Git in VS Code
Supercharge Git and unlock untapped knowledge within your repository to better understand, write, and review code. Focus, collaborate, accelerate.

GitLens is a powerful open-source extension for Visual Studio Code.

GitLens supercharges your Git experience in VS Code. Maintaining focus is critical, extra time spent context switching or missing context disrupts your flow. GitLens is the ultimate tool for making Git work for you, designed to improve focus, productivity, and collaboration with a powerful set of tools to help you and your team better understand, write, and review code.

GitLens sets itself apart from other Git tools through its deep level of integration, versatility, and ease of use.

We know Git is hard and strive to make it as easy as possible while also going beyond the basics with rich visualizations and step-by-step guidance and safety, just to name a few.
